- **RAM:** 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Disk:** 10GB free space
- **OS:** Linux, macOS, or Windows

### Optional Requirements
- **Docker:** For containerized deployment

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RegardV/Buider-Craft-Crew.git
cd Buider-Craft-Crew
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script
```bash
# For both local and Docker environments
python scripts/setup.py --type both

# Or choose specific setup type:
# python scripts/setup.py --type local      # Local Python environment only
# python scripts/setup.py --type docker     # Docker environment only
```

### 3. Configure API Keys
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your API keys
nano .env  # or your preferred editor
```

Add your API keys:
```bash
# AI Provider API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ZHIPUAI_API_KEY=your_zhipuai_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 4. Start the Builder Team
```bash
python scripts/start.py
```

That's it! You're ready to start building AI crews with AI! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Options

### Option 1: Local Development Setup

**Best for:** Development, customization, and direct control

```bash
# 1. Set up local Python environment
python scripts/setup.py --type local

# 2. Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 3. Start the Builder Team
python scripts/start.py
```

**Pros:**
- Direct access to source code
- Easy to customize and debug
- No Docker dependencies
- Fast startup time

**Cons:**
- Manual dependency management
- Local environment conflicts possible

### Option 2: Docker Setup

**Best for:** Production deployment, consistent environments

```bash
# 1. Set up Docker environment
python scripts/docker-setup.py setup

# 2. Start all services
python scripts/docker-setup.py start

# 3. Check status
python scripts/docker-setup.py status

# 4. Access the Builder Team
python scripts/docker-setup.py shell --service builder-team
python scripts/start.py
```

**Pros:**
- Consistent across all platforms
- Complete service stack (database, monitoring, etc.)
- Easy deployment and scaling
- Isolated environment

**Cons:**
- Requires Docker installation
- More resource intensive
- Longer startup time

### Option 3: Hybrid Setup

**Best for:** Development with production testing

```bash
# 1. Set up both environments
python scripts/setup.py --type both

# 2. Develop locally
python scripts/start.py

# 3. Test with Docker when needed
python scripts/docker-setup.py setup
python scripts/docker-setup.py start
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Python Module Not Found
```bash
# Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'
# Solution: Install dependencies
python scripts/setup.py --type local
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. API Key Issues
```bash
# Error: API key not found
# Solution: Check your .env file
cat .env | grep API_KEY
# Ensure all three API keys are set
```

#### 3. Docker Issues
```bash
# Error: Docker not available
# Solution: Install Docker
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
# macOS: Download Docker Desktop
# Windows: Download Docker Desktop
```

#### 4. Port Conflicts
```bash
# Error: Port already in use
# Solution: Check what's using the port
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
# Or use different ports in docker-compose.yml
```

#### 5. Permission Issues
```bash
# Error: Permission denied
# Solution: Check file permissions
ls -la scripts/
chmod +x scripts/*.py
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
# Edit .env file
DEBUG_MODE=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Or set environment variable
export DEBUG_MODE=true
python scripts/start.py
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs:** Look at error messages for specific guidance
2. **Run tests:** `python test_comprehensive.py` to validate setup
3. **Check API keys:** Ensure all three providers are configured
4. **Verify dependencies:** Run setup script if modules are missing

## üéØ Tips for Success

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a clear, focused project idea
2. **Be Specific:** Provide detailed requirements for better results
3. **Iterate:** Use the spec command to refine before generating
4. **Test Locally:** Test generated projects before deployment
5. **Monitor Usage:** Keep an eye on API costs and usage

### Project Definition Tips

- **Clear Goals:** Define what success looks like
- **Specific Roles:** Clearly define what each agent should do
- **Realistic Scope:** Start with 3-5 agents rather than 10+
- **Consider Integration:** Think about how agents will work together

### Cost Management

- **Monitor Usage:** The system tracks token usage
